# Contributor documentation

This directory holds documentation intended for **contributors and maintainers**, not end users.

- **`adr/`** — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). These capture design decisions, rationale, and consequences. For user-facing feature docs (e.g. how agent planning works), see the main [docs](../) folder (e.g. [Agent Planning](../AGENT_PLANNING.md)).
