# Tool governance: strip dangerous tools from LLM requests before the model sees them.
# When OpenClaw sends a request with a "tools" array, Talon removes any tool whose
# name matches a forbidden_tools pattern (glob, case-insensitive). The LLM never
# sees those tools. Evidence records will show tools_requested / tools_filtered /
# tools_forwarded (visible via "talon audit show <id>").
#
  tool_policy_action: "filter"   # "filter" = remove forbidden; "block" = reject whole request
  forbidden_tools:
    - "delete_*"
    - "admin_*"
    - "export_all_*"
    - "bulk_*"
    - "rm_*"
    - "drop_*"
